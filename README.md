# Final-year-project

==> Instruction:

You have to use CV_similarity.pkl and updatedDf.pkl. Inside the app.py file I have written the whole code. I have made a get_productid_categoryid function, it will return recommended products_Id and also the product category_Id in a json format. If you want you can change function name.


Add Data Preprocessing.py file that is contain a function for full data preprocess. Make sure "Model And New dataset/products_product.csv" file exist. this is the dataset that you will be train when you need to train on new data.
